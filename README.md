This file is to present my progress in webdevelopment. First project is very simple (El.Papriko, cars), second has some additional features (Yellow), third is a little bit more complex (Malina).
The first projects from this file can be compared with recently added project so as to check what was my starting point at webdevelopment and what I've learnt so far.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Status
Project is: _in progress_ - media queries to be added.

## Inspiration
All projects are based on ready layouts received during my programming course or found on the Internet.
