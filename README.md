## General info
Websites are not responsive.
This file is to present my progress in webdevelopment. Two of them are very simple:
* el.papriko, ![el.papriko layout](https://github.com/eemila/Hello-world/blob/master/el-papriko/el-papriko.jpg)
* cars ![cars layout](https://github.com/eemila/Hello-world/blob/master/cars/samochody.jpg)

and two - a little bit more complex: 

* yellow  ![yellow layout](https://github.com/eemila/Hello-world/blob/master/yellow/zolty%20layout.jpg)
* malina ![malina layout](https://github.com/eemila/Hello-world/blob/master/malina/malina-layout.jpg)

The first projects from this file can be compared with recently added projects so as to check what was my starting point at webdevelopment and what I've learnt so far.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Status
* Malina: _in progress_ - map with marker to be added

## Inspiration
All projects are based on ready layouts received during my programming course.
