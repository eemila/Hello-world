## General info
Websites are not responsive (yet).
This file is to present my progress in webdevelopment. Two of them are very simple (El.Papriko, cars) and two - a little bit more complex (Yellow, Malina).
The first projects from this file can be compared with recently added projects so as to check what was my starting point at webdevelopment and what I've learnt so far.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Status
* El.Papriko: _in progress_ - media queries to be added
* Cars: _in progress_ - media queries to be added
* Yellow: _in progress_ - media queries to be added
* Malina: _in progress_ - media queries to be added, map with marker to be added

## Inspiration
All projects are based on ready layouts received during my programming course.
